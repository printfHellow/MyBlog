            <p>I finished at FPT University with 2.8/4.0 GPA （︶^︶), yeah it is a normal GPA and I didn't join any code
                challenge when I was learning at these University
                cuz I'm just a chill guy <img src="/img/hqdefault.jpg" alt="meme chill guy in 2024" width="50px"> I just
                wanna do something creative when I follow IT way (～￣▽￣)～.
                Someone say that if I wanna make a huge money ( $ _ $ )about doing IT you must try hard and learn so
                much to become top 1 IT. But for me, I just want to make enough money for my life and spend time to take
                care my family :v. That's all.

            <h1>3. Hobby</h1>
            <p>As many man in the world, Game is one of my Hobby╰(*°▽°*)╯. I play some game and watch others(Youtubers, Streamers) play. Some people say that play game is a wasting time. In my opinion, play game especially offline games like you read books or watch movies. They have story, lesion and entertainment so spend time with them worth every peny. Trust me bro :v. You just waste time when you can't balance your life activities.</p>
            <p> 
                I also like hearing someone express their feelings about a book. I know that sound ridiculous, I'm quite lazy to reading book(❁´◡`❁)(and I'm not nerd), but I love someone reading interesting book and tell me stories how they feel about it. My favorite channel is Better Version where share knowledge, personal experience about books.
